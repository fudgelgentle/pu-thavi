      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="hide">This was my first ever UX project and my first exposure to the UX industry. Apart from learning and experiencing UX workflow and principles, there were many takeaways I got from this internship:</h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="hide"><b>1. Design is not art:‍</b></h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="hide">The difference between design and art is that that design always has a purpose. UX Design is not only about making pretty products. It’s about following a user-centered design process to deliver a product that not only satisfies the user’s needs but also provides them with a meaningful experience.</h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="hide"><b>2. Never make any assumptions, you are NOT the user:</b></h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="hide">‍It was sometimes tempting to base design choices on what I assumed was good for the user. However, designers can never accurately represent the target user because they have spent much more time and depth studying the product. Instead, we should always design iteratively and exploratively by frequently involving users, getting critiques, and making analysis and refinements.</h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="hide"><b>3. Exercise UX principles with caution:</b></h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="hide">‍Although it is crucial to be aware of different design principles and heuristics, we cannot blindly apply them without context. We need to first understand the end goal of our design, learn about our users and their behaviors, and understand the trade-offs between different design principles.</h3>
