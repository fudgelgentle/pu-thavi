        <h4>Hi, I‚Äôm Pu! Currently studying Computer Science at University of Washington. I grew up in Bangkok, Thailand and have lived there for 18 years. Currently, I am living in Seattle, WA.</h4>
        <h4>I decided to make a switch from Software Engineering to UX Design after my first UX Design internship. While I enjoy programming and its technical aspect, I have always been a visual person who likes everyday design. UX Design, for me, gives me a way to solve problems and give people meaningful experiences through incorporating both technical work and visual creativity.</h4>
        <h4>Outside of work, I enjoy traveling to different parts of the world üõ©Ô∏è, playing video games üéÆ, and watching anime.</h4>
