      <h2>Ourdate Dating Profile Redesign</h2>
      <h3>I worked alongside two other designers to redesign the profile page of Ourdate app.</h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3 class="bold">The Problem:</h3>
      <h3>The original profile page design <span class="bold">fails</span> to communicate our app goal of encouraging users to meet each other in-person.</h3>
      <img src="img/old_profile.png" id="old-profile" alt="Image of the old profile design">
      <h3>Based on multiple testing sessions we conducted with Ourdate users, the original profile <span class="bold">doesn’t show enough ‘personality’</span> of that a person despite having lots of information about them.</h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3>We spent a lot of time researching and brainstorming on ways to bring life out of the profile page. Through conducting interviews, it became evident that showcasing images or videos of users doing their favorite activities is an effective and natural way to show their personality.</h3>
      <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
      <h3>We synthesized all of the findings we got from user testing and went through multiple design iterations and feedback session from both our users and the design team.</h3>

      <h3 class="bold">Final Profile Redesign:</h3>
